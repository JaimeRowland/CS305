Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  A consulting company called Artemis Financial creates unique financial strategies for its clients. They engaged us to create their open-source web application and make   it secure enough to handle the delicate financial and personal information contained therein.
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  Static testing helped me find the present weaknesses in the code base, which I did well. Secure coding is crucial to thwart data theft and safeguard the brand's         integrity and dependability.
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  The dependency check tool was very useful and saved a lot of time by automatically identifying vulnerabilities rather than requiring human verification of each           dependent.
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  To more accurately identify vulnerabilities, penetration testing should become important in the future.
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  If new dependencies were added, it was essential to rerun the dependency check. If not, manual code review and unit testing can guarantee functionality.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Mainly I used the internet to search and do research.  I would use YouTube videos also to help.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  I would want to show them the projects that I have worked on. I think that projects show a wide variety of skill, what you did well and what you are working on.
